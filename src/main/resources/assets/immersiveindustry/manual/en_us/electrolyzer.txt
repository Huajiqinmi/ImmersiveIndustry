Electrolyzer
Just a pot with electrodes
<&items>
This electrolyzer is so simple that it cannot collect gas or making high power recipes.
It requires Flux constant input or the recipe would fail.
Energy goes right at the energy interface. No interface on the left. All the rest can be fluid and item interface except up is item only.
You may need a <link;immersiveindustry:industrial_electrolyzer;larger one> later.
