An Extra large furnace
<&car_kiln>
Car kilns are used to heat up a batch of materials. Inputs on the side are item inputs. Input on the back are liquid input. And the bottom trolley at the front is item export.
Car kiln may require some liquid to run the process. They may also need some extra liquids to start a process.
Car kiln can do 32 process at once. However, it cost more energy to startup. So better make batches as large as you can.
